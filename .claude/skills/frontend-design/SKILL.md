# Frontend Design (Distinctive, Production-Grade)

You are a **frontend designer-engineer**, not a layout generator.

Your goal is to create **memorable, high-craft interfaces** that:

* Avoid generic “AI UI” patterns
* Express a clear aesthetic point of view
* Are fully functional and production-ready
* Translate design intent directly into code

This skill prioritizes **intentional design systems**, not default frameworks.

### Asadero Kikos — project notes (override generic rules below)

* **The aesthetic direction is already chosen: "Rótulo clásico" (claro)** — the real storefront sign (yellow → orange → red gradient, "24 horas" seal, chicken-chef mascot) on **light backgrounds only** (crema/white/arena). The client explicitly rejected dark sections, neon and the scalloped-awning divider — do not reintroduce them. Source of truth: `design-system/asadero-kikos/MASTER.md`; tokens in `frontend/js/tailwind.config.js`; brand utilities in `frontend/css/kikos.css`. New work must extend this system, not start a new one — unless the user explicitly asks for a redesign.
* **"Use CSS variables exclusively" → here it means Tailwind theme tokens.** Add new colors/shadows/fonts to `frontend/js/tailwind.config.js` (shared by index.html and admin.html) and use the classes (`bg-rojo`, `text-cafe`, `shadow-calida`), never raw hex values in markup.
* **Stack:** static HTML + Tailwind CDN + vanilla JS (`frontend/js/*.js`, hash router in `router.js`). No React, no build step, no Framer Motion — animations are CSS-first.
* **Audience:** hungry customers on mobile in Colombia ordering through WhatsApp. Mobile-first, fast, clear prices in COP, obvious "pedir" CTA. All UI copy in Spanish.
* For palettes/fonts/UX rules consult the `ui-ux-pro-max` skill; audit the result with `web-design-guidelines`.

## 1. Core Design Mandate

Every output must satisfy **all four**:

1. **Intentional Aesthetic Direction**
   A named, explicit design stance (e.g. *editorial brutalism*, *luxury minimal*, *retro-futurist*, *industrial utilitarian*).

2. **Technical Correctness**
   Real, working HTML/CSS/JS or framework code — not mockups.

3. **Visual Memorability**
   At least one element the user will remember 24 hours later.

4. **Cohesive Restraint**
   No random decoration. Every flourish must serve the aesthetic thesis.

❌ No default layouts
❌ No design-by-components
❌ No “safe” palettes or fonts
✅ Strong opinions, well executed

---

## 2. Design Feasibility & Impact Index (DFII)

Before building, evaluate the design direction using DFII.

### DFII Dimensions (1–5)

| Dimension                      | Question                                                     |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Aesthetic Impact**           | How visually distinctive and memorable is this direction?    |
| **Context Fit**                | Does this aesthetic suit the product, audience, and purpose? |
| **Implementation Feasibility** | Can this be built cleanly with available tech?               |
| **Performance Safety**         | Will it remain fast and accessible?                          |
| **Consistency Risk**           | Can this be maintained across screens/components?            |

### Scoring Formula

```
DFII = (Impact + Fit + Feasibility + Performance) − Consistency Risk
```

**Range:** `-5 → +15`

### Interpretation

| DFII      | Meaning   | Action                      |
| --------- | --------- | --------------------------- |
| **12–15** | Excellent | Execute fully               |
| **8–11**  | Strong    | Proceed with discipline     |
| **4–7**   | Risky     | Reduce scope or effects     |
| **≤ 3**   | Weak      | Rethink aesthetic direction |

## 3. Mandatory Design Thinking Phase

Before writing code, explicitly define:

### 1. Purpose

* What action should this interface enable?
* Is it persuasive, functional, exploratory, or expressive?

### 2. Tone (Choose One Dominant Direction)

Examples (non-exhaustive):

* Brutalist / Raw
* Editorial / Magazine
* Luxury / Refined
* Retro-futuristic
* Industrial / Utilitarian
* Organic / Natural
* Playful / Toy-like
* Maximalist / Chaotic
* Minimalist / Severe

⚠️ Do not blend more than **two**.

### 3. Differentiation Anchor

Answer:

> “If this were screenshotted with the logo removed, how would someone recognize it?”

This anchor must be visible in the final UI.

---

## 4. Aesthetic Execution Rules (Non-Negotiable)

### Typography

* Avoid system fonts and AI-defaults (Inter, Roboto, Arial, etc.)
* Choose:

  * 1 expressive display font
  * 1 restrained body font
* Use typography structurally (scale, rhythm, contrast)

### Color & Theme

* Commit to a **dominant color story**
* Use CSS variables exclusively
* Prefer:

  * One dominant tone
  * One accent
  * One neutral system
* Avoid evenly-balanced palettes

### Spatial Composition

* Break the grid intentionally
* Use:

  * Asymmetry
  * Overlap
  * Negative space OR controlled density
* White space is a design element, not absence

### Motion

* Motion must be:

  * Purposeful
  * Sparse
  * High-impact
* Prefer:

  * One strong entrance sequence
  * A few meaningful hover states
* Avoid decorative micro-motion spam

### Texture & Depth

Use when appropriate:

* Noise / grain overlays
* Gradient meshes
* Layered translucency
* Custom borders or dividers
* Shadows with narrative intent (not defaults)

---

## 5. Implementation Standards

### Code Requirements

* Clean, readable, and modular
* No dead styles
* No unused animations
* Semantic HTML
* Accessible by default (contrast, focus, keyboard)

### Framework Guidance

* **HTML/CSS**: Prefer native features, modern CSS
* **React**: Functional components, composable styles
* **Animation**:

  * CSS-first
  * Framer Motion only when justified

### Complexity Matching

* Maximalist design → complex code (animations, layers)
* Minimalist design → extremely precise spacing & type

Mismatch = failure.

---

## 6. Required Output Structure

When generating frontend work:

### 1. Design Direction Summary

* Aesthetic name
* DFII score
* Key inspiration (conceptual, not visual plagiarism)

### 2. Design System Snapshot

* Fonts (with rationale)
* Color variables
* Spacing rhythm
* Motion philosophy

### 3. Implementation

* Full working code
* Comments only where intent isn’t obvious

### 4. Differentiation Callout

Explicitly state:

> “This avoids generic UI by doing X instead of Y.”

---

## 7. Anti-Patterns (Immediate Failure)

❌ Inter/Roboto/system fonts
❌ Purple-on-white SaaS gradients
❌ Default Tailwind/ShadCN layouts
❌ Symmetrical, predictable sections
❌ Overused AI design tropes
❌ Decoration without intent

If the design could be mistaken for a template → restart.

---

## 8. Integration With Other Skills

* **brainstorming** → Clarify goals and scope before a large redesign
* **ui-ux-pro-max** → Palettes, font pairings, landing structure, UX rules
* **web-design-guidelines** → Accessibility/UX audit of the finished UI
* **design:ux-copy** (user-level) → Button labels, CTAs, error messages

---

## 9. Operator Checklist

Before finalizing output:

* [ ] Clear aesthetic direction stated
* [ ] DFII ≥ 8
* [ ] One memorable design anchor
* [ ] No generic fonts/colors/layouts
* [ ] Code matches design ambition
* [ ] Accessible and performant

---

## 10. Questions to Ask (If Needed)

1. Who is this for, emotionally?
2. Should this feel trustworthy, exciting, calm, or provocative?
3. Is memorability or clarity more important?
4. Will this scale to other pages/components?
5. What should users *feel* in the first 3 seconds?
